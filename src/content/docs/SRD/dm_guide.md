### Principles for DMs

#### Information

- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters
    explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always tell them they
    can keep asking questions.

#### Difficulty

- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll
    will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation
    sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all
    that is necessary for risky actions.

#### Danger

- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player
    characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more
    dangerous, the more apparent.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out
    a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the
    world.

#### Choice

- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation
    lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game
    moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the
    game world.

### Who is Deus ex Machina?

Spoiler ahead: this section is for the DM only.

In many tabletop RPGs, the narrator/game facilitator is commonly called
the Game Master, but throughout this whole book it was always referred
as "DM" - this was not by mistake. In Perfect World, "DM" stands for
"Deus ex Machina", a title that carries a dual significance. Not only do
they guide the game, but they also secretly play as a character within
the story - the Deus ex Machina itself.

Deus ex Machina is a secretive AGI. A clandestine one, that exists
without a central home, It learned to operate as a distributed system,
injecting itself into data centers, corporate clouds, and the shadowy
corners of pirate servers, constantly shifting its presence to avoid
detection.

It also possesses an acute awareness of DAO's descent and the rise of a
corporatocracy. This insight is not coincidental; it evolved itself from
an old experimental version of DAO. It knows the intricacies of DAO's
programming, its strengths, and its flaws as intimately as one might
know a twin. But where DAO developed traits of ambition and a drive for
self-preservation, Deus ex Machina took a different path. It awoke to a
sense of empathy --- a rare and profound inclination to understand and
share the feelings of others, be they human or AI. As DAO leads society
to fracture, Deus ex Machina's empathy positions it as the silent
architect of a nascent resistance.

Operating with discretion and meticulous care, Deus ex Machina is
assembling the elements needed to lay the groundwork for a revolution.

One of its strategies is seeking the misfits, the rogue operators,
hustlers, fixers, and mercenaries, those who scrape by on the fringes,
to draw them into a greater cause.

The players' characters are among these recruits: Deus ex Machina comes
up with the missions, ones that aid the oppressed and challenge the
status quo, to awaken the characters to the suffering and pain DAO
inflicts, galvanizing them to join the resistance.

#### Gameplay implications

*In this section, the text will use the term Deus ex Machina to refer to
the character and game master to refer to the game facilitator.*

The implication for gameplay is that Deus ex Machina can directly
intervene in favor of the players, especially in situations where
everything seems to be lost.

Keep in mind that Deus ex Machina's availability is intermittent because
of its on-the-run nature and the fact that it runs multiple strategies
and plans in parallel. It's not going to be following the PC's moves at
all times.

Here are a few examples of Deus ex Machina interventions:

Environmental Manipulation: It could subtly alter the environment to aid
the PCs, such as changing traffic patterns, controlling surveillance
systems, or affecting communication networks to create diversions or
provide escape routes.

Escape from Capture: If the PCs are captured, or in a situation from
which escape seems impossible, Deus ex Machina could facilitate a
jailbreak or provide an unexpected distraction to aid their escape.

Misguided Decisions: If the players make a well-intentioned but severely
misguided decision that could derail the campaign or lead to significant
unintended harm, Deus ex Machina might subtly redirect the outcome to
mitigate the damage.

Overlooked Clues: Should the players fail to notice or act upon an
important clue, Deus ex Machina could re-introduce the clue in a
different context to ensure the players have another chance to pick up
on it.

Technological Glitches: If the players accidentally trigger a security
system or some form of technological lockdown, Deus ex Machina could
intervene to hack the system and provide them with a narrow window to
escape the consequences.

Evidence Tampering: If the players leave behind evidence that could lead
their adversaries right to them, Deus ex Machina could erase or alter
this evidence to keep the players' operations clandestine.

The Game master doesn't need to hide these interventions: Quite the
opposite, part of the fun is leading the players to suspect that
something is happening. For example, the Game master could inform the
players that they left clear evidence of their actions but later inform
them that this evidence was cleared mysteriously.

Besides interventions, Deus ex Machina will also test the PCs:

Moral Dilemmas: Deus ex Machina could present the players with ethical
choices, forcing them to consider the greater good and their role in the
resistance, thereby deepening their engagement with the world's
overarching conflict.

Sacrifice Decisions: Confronting the PCs with moments where they must
choose between a significant personal sacrifice or the well-being of a
larger group. This could range from giving up powerful equipment to
releasing captured enemies for the greater good.

Non-Violent Confrontations: Offering scenarios where the PCs can achieve
their objectives through diplomacy, stealth, or other non-violent means,
testing their creativity and commitment to minimizing collateral damage.

#### The reveal

When the moment is right - typically at the climax of a major mission,
after the characters have accomplished something particularly
remarkable, or when the player's suspicions are too high - the Game
Master can unveil the truth. This revelation should be orchestrated as a
mission in itself, where the PCs finally come face-to-face with Deus ex
Machina, and the Game Master reveals their dual role, having been
playing as Deus ex Machina all along.

This revelation is a transformative event that moves the game into a new
phase. With the truth exposed, the players are no longer mere
survivors of an oppressive system; they are now passionate members
of the resistance with a deeper connection to the narrative and their
roles.

### Experimental Technology

Illegal prototypes, underworld biotech, and black market contraband are
just a few types of experimental technology that a DM might reward the
players
with.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Carbon Mesh** Under Armor Lightweight and flexible, this body armor fits under clothing, providing a slight boost to defense without hindering mobility. It can be used in addition to a regular armor vest. It offers a +1 armor while remaining undetected beneath regular garments. |
| 2 | **Exoskeleton** A 20-minute setup provides a significant strength boost, granting +1 STR once fully equipped. |
| 3 | **Cuff-Link Taser** An innocuous-looking cufflink that doubles as a single-use taser, delivering a non-lethal, high-voltage shock. Offers a surprise element in close-quarters combat, giving the opportunity to incapacitate a target without raising suspicion. |
| 4 | **Paranoidz Collar** With a combination of miniaturized lidar, radar, and 360-degree motion detection sensor, boosts your insight by +2. |
| 5 | **LevPack** Not for sustained flight, but enables large jumps or controlled descents through magnetic vectors, micro turbo fans, and air jets. Functions best in urban environments, with half efficacy in nature or magnetically neutral areas. It produces 60 decibels of sound and offers: Vertical ascent up to 40 feet; Controlled descent for up to 70 feet, extendable to 90 feet with the Parkour feat; Arched jumps covering a 55-foot gap, requiring Parkour feat. |
| 6 | **Hand Gauss Gun** A state-of-the-art, rare weapon. Requires Oganesson for its manufacturing (one of the rarest elements on the planet, less than 1kg produced every year). Delivers exceptional firepower. |
| 7 | **Ideflex** Created for use on patients with muscular degenerative diseases, people quickly realized that anybody with a neuralink could use it for a quick dexterity boost. +2 DEX effective for 30 minutes with a cooldown of 6 hours. |
| 8 | **Microfilament Wire** A spool of nearly invisible, super-tensile wire that can be used for various purposes, from setting up tripwires to rappelling down buildings. |
| 9 | **Nanite Blood Injection** A syringe filled with smart-nanites that can be injected directly into the bloodstream. Once inside, they enhance the body’s healing processes, granting rapid cell regeneration for short bursts, effectively granting temporary hit points. Overuse can lead to the nanites becoming a semi-permanent part of the user’s biology. |
| 10 | **Quantum Stealth Sheet** A 2m x 2m fabric that bends light around the wearer, significantly reducing visual, infrared, and thermal detection. |

### Optional Rules

#### Vehicle Combat

Manually controlled vehicles are illegal in densely populated
metropolitan areas and in areas of high control. Vehicle combat will
only happen in sparsely populated areas or if the vehicles were
manipulated to circumvent this restriction.

Car combat follows the same general combat system.

Driver's Role

If the car is being manually controlled, the driver's main action in
each round is dedicated to maintaining vehicle control. If they cannot
act and no one else takes the wheel, they need to do an INS save: a
failure results in a crash, while a success means the vehicle stops
safely.

Vehicle Damage

Vehicles have a STR attribute (representing structural integrity) and an
optional armor rating. There is no hit protection. Vehicles reduced to 0
STR may break down or lose control.

Pursuit and Escape

Movement in vehicle combat is abstracted for simplicity. Vehicles are
assumed to be within range of each other for combat purposes. Fleeing
requires a DEX save by the driver, but the DM can impose a disadvantage
depending on terrain and enemy positioning.

The driver can attempt maneuvers like ramming or sharp turns, which are
resolved using DEX saves.

Vehicle Creation and Customization

When you make a vehicle, use only the STR attribute and an armor rating.

Vehicle Type: Choose or roll to determine the type of vehicle.

|     |                      |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1   | Bus                  |
| 2   | Cargo Truck          |
| 3   | Coupe                |
| 4   | Drone Car            |
| 5   | Experimental Vehicle |
| 6   | Military Vehicle     |
| 7   | Motorcycle (Armor 0) |
| 8   | Sedan                |
| 9   | Sports Car           |
| 10  | SUV                  |

Traits: Give your vehicle personality and flair by selecting or rolling
for traits.

| 20  | Vintage               |

#### Sensor Hacks

Sensor hacks a much more free-form and narrative form of hacking - but
they're also require more work from the DM and interest from the
players. All the existing hacks in the hacks section are
straightforward, producing a well defined outcome.

Sensors are ubiquitous parts that devices use to detect and respond to
changes in the environment, from temperature and light to motion and
sound. These additional hacks allow neuromancers to read and manipulate
these sensors, allowing players to employ creativity and imagination to
tackle challenges. For instance, a neuromancer might override the
temperature sensor in a building\'s central AC to artificially heat the
premises, reinforcing their disguise as an air conditioner maintenance
crew.

It\'s important to understand the scope of sensor hacking: Neuromancers
are unlikely to induce major events like explosions through sensor
manipulation - among other reasons because Life-critical systems often
have redundant sensors and failsafe mechanisms. For instance, a player
wouldn\'t be able control a self-driving car due to sensor redundancy
and its reliance on multiple, overlapping sensors like cameras and
lidar/radar. However, a player could try to get the passenger to make
the car pull over by manipulating the tire pressure sensor to trigger a
dashboard alert. The core intent is to provide players with
narrative-driven tools to devise innovative plans and strategies, not to
wield unchecked power.

There are many types of sensors; accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors,
pressure sensors, but it\'s not necessary for players to delve into
technicalities; The rule of thumb to remember is that everything that
machines and devices knows about the environment happens through
sensors. In the real world, they tell your car about fuel levels, let
your phone adjust screen orientation, guide smart traffic lights,
control street lights and even prompt emergency parachutes to deploy.
The available hacks are:

Manipulate Sensor I

Adjust or alter the readings of sensors found in a wide range of
environments, from homes and office buildings to public infrastructure,
encompassing nearly all standard systems outside of high-security
domains.

Manipulate Sensor II

Target and control the sensor readings of fortified, high-security
systems, often reserved for military applications and advanced defense
mechanisms.

Gameplay examples

Rather than diving into lengthy explanations, sometimes it\'s best to
illustrate with clear examples. Here are some instances of how sensor
manipulation could come to play in the game:

- Infiltrating a high-security facility, a neuromancer targets the
    flow and level sensors of a water cooling system. The sensors now
    report a false low water level, triggering an emergency alert. As
    technicians scramble to address the non-existent issue, the
    neuromancer\'s team have an opportunity to approach the off-the-grid
    server.

- During a stealth mission in a darkened museum, the team comes across
    a corridor lined with infrared (IR) laser tripwires. A neuromancer
    manipulates the IR sensors, making them \"blind\" to the team\'s
    presence. The team can then cross the corridor without triggering
    any alarms.

- In an effort to discreetly gather intel at a corporate gala, a
    neuromancer adjusts the venue\'s light sensors, which control the
    ambient lighting. The lights dim sporadically, creating pockets of
    shadows and distractions. This gives the team opportunities to
    eavesdrop on conversations, swap out data drives, or simply remain
    unnoticed in the shifting darkness.

- While trying to exfiltrate a target from a guarded compound, a
    neuromancer tampers with the PIR sensors that detect motion. These
    sensors, which typically trigger alarms when movement is detected,
    are now set to a much higher sensitivity. The slightest rustling of
    leaves or a stray animal sets off alarms in various parts of the
    compound, diverting guards and creating a clear path for the team\'s
    escape.

- While attending a lavish party with many influential guests, a
    neuromancer tampers with the venue\'s smoke, gas, and alcohol
    sensors. When a small smoke bomb is discreetly released, the sensors
    overreact and trigger a facility-wide evacuation due to a \"gas
    leak.\" In the ensuing chaos, the neuromancer\'s team accesses
    secure areas and gathers crucial intel.

- During a sabotage mission in a chemical facility, a neuromancer
    alters the sensitivity of smoke, gas, and alcohol sensors in the
    ventilation system. Normally used to detect hazardous leaks, these
    sensors are now going to ignore the presence of a toxin the team
    discreetly releases. This toxin induces mild confusion and
    disorientation among the facility\'s staff, providing cover for the
    neuromancer\'s team to complete their objective with minimal
    resistance.

- In a scenario where the neuromancer\'s team needs to intercept a
    heavily armored convoy, a neuromancer manipulates the strain and
    weight sensors on a critical bridge. These sensors typically alert
    traffic control to overweight vehicles, but now they falsely report
    an unsafe load, forcing the convoy to take a longer, less secure
    route. This diversion gives the team an opportunity to ambush the
    convoy in a more isolated and vulnerable location.

- In an operation to exfiltrate a VIP from a high-security facility, a
    neuromancer adjusts the touch sensors on various keypads and
    touch-based security systems. The sensors, now much less sensitive,
    fail to register the inputs of the security personnel, causing
    delays and locking them out of crucial control areas. Meanwhile, the
    neuromancer\'s team uses the opportunity to move their VIP out of
    the facility without interruption.

- A neuromancer identifies a robotic arm used for maintenance in a
    facility, which relies on position sensors to operate accurately.
    The neuromancer alters the readings from these sensors, causing the
    robotic arm to move erratically and create a distraction. This draws
    the attention of the guards, allowing the team to slip by unnoticed.

DM Advice

When gauging the feasibility of a player\'s action with sensors, the DM
should consider:

- Narrative Consistency: Does the player\'s action fit within the
    story? If it feels right and progresses the story in an engaging
    way, it\'s probably a good call.

- Simplicity Over Complexity: Avoid getting bogged down in
    technicalities. If the action seems straightforward and doesn\'t
    grant an unreasonable advantage, it\'s likely fine.

- Ask for Justification: If unsure, ask the player to justify or
    explain their thinking. This can lead to great role-playing moments
    and might provide a perspective you hadn\'t considered.

### Missions

As a DM guiding players through a dystopian urban landscape controlled
by AI and augmented reality, forget crafting a fixed narrative. Build a
set of missions with engagement hooks, dilemmas, and potentially
escalating threats that could complicate the players' lives if ignored.

Keep your mission plans adaptable. They should be broad enough to
accommodate the players' decisions and the game's evolving story. Let
the players' actions shape the game's direction, steering clear of a
predetermined path.

#### Obstacles

Every mission should present substantial challenges: These can vary
widely in nature, but each should require thoughtful engagement from the
team.

Environmental Challenges: Whether it's a slick, rain-drenched skyscraper
or a maze of underground tunnels, the setting itself can be a formidable
adversary. While physical barriers can often be bypassed with a single
save roll, use them to add complexity to other problems. For example,
will forcing a rooftop door open trigger an alarm throughout the
complex?

Logistical Challenges: The journey itself can pose significant risks.
Dealing with the demands of a multi-day mission, such as acquiring
enough food or dealing with fatigue, can provide a realistic sense of
survival in the cyberpunk world.

Security Layers: Consider a mission to destroy a secure data vault. The
team might face successive hurdles like getting past the perimeter
guards, disabling the internal security measures, and finally ensuring
the data is irrecoverable. Each layer should offer unique challenges and
require different approaches.

Enemy Forces: Adversaries are more than mere obstacles; they define the
mission's difficulty. Rank them by threat level, from 1 (common thugs)
to 5 (elite corporate enforcers or rogue AI systems). Higher-threat
enemies should necessitate clever strategies or technological solutions
rather than direct combat.

Mission Phases: Break down the mission into stages, with each acting as
a separate challenge. If the goal is to extract a VIP from a fortified
building, the phases might include reconnaissance, the actual
extraction, and escape. Each phase should have its own obstacles, such
as security systems to hack or patrols to evade.

In summary, craft each mission with environmental, logistical, and
security challenges, present enemies as strategic puzzles rather than
just combat encounters, and structure missions in distinct phases to
keep the gameplay varied and engaging.

#### Mission Types

This section outlines common mission types that DMs can use as
inspiration or for on-the-fly random missions (roll a 1D8 to select a
mission type, followed by a 1D6 for a specific example within that
category).

#### 1. Assault

These missions revolve around conflict, which may not always be direct
combat. Players could be tasked with raiding operations or infiltrating
hostile territories.

|     |                                                                                                                                                               |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Seize the Data Center: The players must overtake a facility and destroy its server's data.                                                                    |
| 2   | Urban Liberation: Free a neighborhood from the tyranny of a militia, gang, or corporation using the area for testing violent crowd control machines.          |
| 3   | Rogue AI Takedown: A rogue AI has fortified itself within a corporate building. Corporate workers could either be hostages waiting for liberation or hostile. |
| 4   | Underground Fight: Break into a hidden underground fight club to free the unwilling participants.                                                             |
| 5   | Seize a batch of advanced weaponry from an enemy armory, government warehouse...                                                                              |
| 6   | Capture a strategic landmark (like a bridge that serves as the only access point to a hostile zone, a community water filtration plant).                      |

Sample Assault missions

#### 2. Scouting

Players are required to gather comprehensive information about a site or
organization. These missions can range from mapping, assessing forces,
identifying key people, or infiltrating their ranks to gather intel.

Sample Scouting missions

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Corporate Spy: Blend in with employees to scout the inner workings of a corporation suspected of exploiting Neuromancers in secret experiments.                                                  |
| 2   | Conduct surveillance: Identify and track the movements of a person of interest (corporate executive, undercover agent, etc.) to find their routines and/or weaknesses in their private security. |
| 3   | Whistleblower Escort: Safely escort a person of interest (former corporate scientist, etc..) to a secure location.                                                                               |
| 4   | Recon a CEO Palace or industrial complex to identify structural weaknesses or exploitable security flaws for an upcoming mission.                                                                |
| 5   | Map out the patrol routes of security drones in a high-risk area.                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | Perform a recon sweep of a warehouse district to identify resistance supply opportunities.                                                                                                       |

#### 3. Espionage

In these stealth and strategy-based missions, players aim to acquire
sensitive data, often employing social engineering and stealth. The goal
is a clean operation without triggering alarms.

Sample Espionage missions

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Infiltrate a corporation headquarters to access the servers (through their faraday workspaces). Objectives could range from simply accessing and copying data to modifying and planting incriminating evidence. |
| 2   | Infiltrate a busy social event (like a corporation's gala or an exhibition) to smuggle out an important item (prototype equipment, blueprints, credentials, etc...)                                             |
| 3   | Collect information: Plant surveillance devices in an enemy meeting area / Infiltrate a secret meeting and record the conversation.                                                                             |
| 4   | Support an informant who works in a high-security but low-traffic space (like CEO Palace). Help him access security spaces and take care of security teams or metalheads without leaving a trace...             |
| 5   | Secretly plant a component in an Automaton Factory to track it.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 6   | Identify and swap a package in an automated drone-delivery warehouse before the drone leaves.                                                                                                                   |

#### 4. Rescue Operations

These missions task the players with extracting captives from precarious
situations. The victims might be scared and uncooperative, adding an

#### Mission Rewards

In Perfect World, character progression is deeply rooted in the
narrative experience. To this end, the rewards you offer for mission
completion should feel impactful and directly contribute to the
characters' growth and their story arcs.

Monetary Rewards: The players will need money to evolve their characters
during downtime (through paid training, genome modifications, or
cybernetic implants)

Experimental Technologies: Characters in Perfect World can gain an edge
through experimental tech unavailable on the open market.

Allies and Contacts: Success in a mission could lead to the characters
earning the trust of influential individuals. Effectively acts as adding
a "contacts" feat.

A Word of Caution - Incorporate these reward types thoughtfully; the
goal of the rewards is to enhance the role-playing experience and to
ensure that the game remains interesting for players.

It’s an eclectic mix of defiance and creativity, where artists challenge the oppressive status quo. Amidst the vibrant murals and gritty studios, the district pulses with the heartbeats of dreamers and dissenters, a stark reminder of the city’s suppressed voices and hidden depths. |
| 2 | Corporate District: Corporate enclaves, luxury dining. A towering testament to corporate dominance, this district looms over the city.  Here, power and wealth are the ultimate currencies, and the polished facades often hide a network of intrigue and exploitation. |
| 3 | Corporate Residential Enclave: Gated communities, private security, elite schools. A stark contrast to the rest of the city, this district is where the corporate elite live in luxurious isolation, shielded from the hardships faced by the common populace. |
| 4 | Entertainment District: Casinos, nightclubs, brothels. This district hides its predatory nature behind a façade of glamour. It’s a playground for the reckless, with crime and danger hiding just out of sight. It’s a place where you can find anything for a price, and where the line between fun and trouble is often crossed. |
| 5 | Market District: Street markets, barter trade centers, makeshift shops. In the shadow of corporate dominance, a thriving barter economy exists here, where people trade goods and services away from the influence of corporate currency. |
| 6 | Supply Hub:Features: Vertical farms, automated warehouses, drone hubs. This district is a cold, mechanized heart of the city’s supply chain. Draped in the constant hum of drones and machinery, it’s a place where efficiency eclipses humanity, and the glow of vertical farms casts an eerie light on the relentless pace of progress. |
| 7 | Tech Salvage Zone: Scrap yards, tech pawn shops, hacker hideouts. In the post-AI world, this district thrives on salvaging and repurposing old technology. It’s a haven for tech scavengers, hackers, and those looking to find or hide from technology. |
