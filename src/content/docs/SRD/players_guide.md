## Principles for Players

### Agency

- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are
tools.

- Don't ask only what your character would do; ask what you would do, too.

- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork

- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.

- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other, and
accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration

- Asking questions and listening to details is more useful than any stats,
items, or skills you have.

- Take the DM's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from
seeking more information.

- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to
safely gain information and solve problems.

- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk
things through before getting violent.

### Caution

- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is
the best way to achieve your goals.

- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem
unfavorable.

### Planning

- Think of ways to avoid obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and
fact-finding.

- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

## Ambition

- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.

- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation

The two most important things to know about your character are who they
are and what role you want them to play in their adventures. Find out
what kind of game the DM plans to run and what types of characters he
intends to allow. Then start filling in the details:

### Ability Scores

Four numbers called Ability scores are the building blocks of a
character, representing their innate abilities and characteristics that
help them to perform certain actions. There are four Ability Scores: two
physical (strength and dexterity) and two mental (insight and
willpower). Strength (STR) is raw power, toughness, grit, & stamina.
Dexterity (DEX) related to nimbleness, precision, agility. Insight (INS)
is the ability to read people and the environment. Willpower (WIL) is
your confidence, force of personality.

Ability scores range from 1 to 20. For reference, most normal humans
have scores in the 8-12 range. Scores of 8 or below are evident to
people around you - You might be perceived as frail (for STR), clumsy
(DEX), clueless (INS), or fickle (WIL).

Players can generate their character's ability scores by either rolling
the dice or through a points system - ask the DM if they want to choose
one in specific.

Point-buy: The player can freely distribute 48 points across the four
abilities, with a couple restrictions: every score must be between a
minimum of 8 and a maximum of 15.

Dice Roll: The player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's
ability scores, in order. If a player rolls 1 in a die, they can roll
again. Finally, they may then swap any two of the results.

Example: Ines rolls for her character's STR, resulting in a 3, a 4, and
a 6, totaling 13. The next tree ability rolls result in a 9 for DEX, a
10 for INS, and a 13 for WIL. She decides to swap the 13 and the 9, for
a character with 9 STR, 13 DEX, 10 for INS and and 13 WIL.

### Hit Protection

Hit Protection (HP) reflects the character's ability to avoid damage in
combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude, nor do
they lose it for very long (see Healing). If an attack takes a PC's HP
to 0, the player must roll on the Scars table.

Players using dice rolls to generate their character should roll 1d6 to
determine the PC's starting HP.

Players using points should pick their character's lowest physical
attribute score (STR or DEX) and divide by tree, rounded. Example: Gabe
distributes his 48 points, resulting in a character with 11 STR, 13 DEX,
10 for INS, and 12 WIL. Since the lowest physical attribute is 11 (for
STR), they calculate the HP by dividing 11 by 3 (3.66666) and rounding
it, for a final HP of 4.

### Feats

Feats are a way to further customize a character. They represent
valuable traits that give a mental, physical, or social "edge" over
other characters who otherwise have the same abilities. Characters start
with one feat but can gain more during adventuring.

The tables below list the available feats that a new character can pick
from. The complete lists of feats and their details can be found in
the Feats chapter.

A PC initial Feat should be selected with strategy in mind: they are
tools that can enhance a character\'s strengths or mitigate their
weaknesses. Otherwise, to choose by luck, players should roll 1D4 to
select one of the categories in the tables below then the appropriate
die within that category.

|     | Combat & Survival     |     | Covert & Social Operations |
|-----|-----------------------|-----|----------------------------|
| 1   | Adrenaline Rush       | 1   | Alternate Identity         |
| 2   | Ambidexterity         | 2   | Contacts                   |
| 3   | Hard to Kill          | 3   | Erased                     |
| 4   | Weapon Proficiency    | 4   | Stealthy                   |
| 5   | Unarmed Combatant     | 5   | Charisma                   |

|     |                                      | 8   | Utility Hand               |

Feats marked with (\*) require that the player spend money to
acquire, modify or implant equipment. Check the feats section for more
details, or simply choose the corresponding gear pack.

### Hacking slots

Every player's character (PC) in the game is a neuromancer, able to run
hacks - however, this doesn't necessarily mean that "hackers" are the
only possible type of character. A player can create a character
focused, for example, on raw physical power and have a few hacks that
can help them deal damage. Or an infiltrator kind of character with
hacks related to social engineering and evasion. Of course, creating an
all-in hacker PC capable of breaching systems, manipulating the AR
world, and more is also possible.

PCs possess two initial hack slots, representing the character's
capacity to maintain, recall, and run different neuromancer hacks. As
they advance, characters might expand their hack slots. Characters with
the Neuralhack Expander feat start with three additional hack slots, for
a total of 5, but they have to spend money to buy the implant (See Gear
and Money).

The tables below list the Hacks a new player can choose - for the
complete list and all the details, refer to the Hacks chapter.

Similarly to Feats, Hacks should be selected with strategy in mind.
However, players can still pick randomly by rolling 1D6 to choose one of
the categories in the tables below and then the appropriate die within
that category.

| 6   | Sensory Amplification | 6   | Sense emotion            |

### Gear and money

Every character has a backpack with six slots for gear (it also doubles
as an emergency sleeping bag if emptied of its contents). Additionally,
they can have gear on their body (such as carried weapons, armor, etc)
for a total of 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot, and
small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be
rearranged per the DM's judgment.

PCs have \$5,000 of starting money to buy gear, including armor,
weapons, and tools (Check the Equipment tables for details.)

## Feats

Feats are specialized skills or enhancements that set characters apart,
ranging from background training, natural talent, or cybernetic
modifications. Most feats grant an advantage on specific rolls; however,
some introduce special rules, adding layers of strategy and depth to
gameplay. The DM's role is to weave these feats into the narrative, and
players must strategize with them in mind.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Adrenaline Rush | Any time you roll the maximum value for your damage die, you can make another attack on a different target. |
| Alternate Identity | Maintain a secondary, seemingly legitimate identity with associated documents. Useful for evading identification by agencies. |
| Ambidexterity | Possess equal proficiency with both hands, allowing attacks with two weapons. See combat rules for details. |
| Charisma | A natural flair to captivate and lead others, granting advantage in tasks like persuasion, flirting, entertaining, or distraction. |
| Contacts | You possess a contact who offers valuable intel or performs minor, specific favors for you. |
| Cunning Hands | Excel in tasks requiring precise sleight of hand, like concealing items or subtly placing something on someone. |
| CyberWear: Bionic Hand | A bionic hand adds one point to the character’s DX when performing any manual task involving that hand. |
| CyberWear: Enhanced Lungs | Enhanced lung capacity with filters, allowing for longer breath holding or resistance to airborne toxins. |
| CyberWear: Hidden Compartment | You have a bionic arm or leg with a hidden compartment large enough for any reasonably shaped small object that doesn’t exceed 1 kg. |
| CyberWear: Neuralhack Expander | A specialized interface designed to optimize and compartmentalize neural pathways. Adds 3 more hack slots |
| CyberWear: Thermal Regulation | Implants that allow your body to regulate its temperature, providing resistance to extreme cold or heat. |
| CyberWear: Critical damage stabilizer | Subdermal Implant that disperses bionano-activated stem cells upon critical damage, automatically stabilizing the character to prevent death within the next hour. |
| CyberWear: Dermal Armor | A discreet subcutaneous protective mesh. Adds +1 armor without altering your appearance. |
| CyberWear: Utility Hand | This cybernetic hand contains an assortment of compact, concealed tools, ensuring you’re always equipped for relevant skill tasks. When used as an improvised weapon, it inflicts damage equivalent to a knife. |
| Discriminatory Senses | Your hearing, smell, touch, and taste are above human average: you can see in low light, have an expanded hearing frequency range and can detect subtle vibrations and textures, allowing identification of individuals by voice or machines by sound. Detect substances by taste or smell and sense subtle environmental changes. |
| Drone Master | Ability to control up to 3 drones simultaneously |
| Eidetic Memory | Possess a remarkable memory, allowing automatic success in recalling past events with accurate details. |
| Erased | There are no official records of your existence. Immune to governmental or corporate persecutions, but risks arise if detected. However, if discovered, you may face intensive scrutiny and interrogation. |
| Escape Artist | Gain advantage when rolling to wriggle free from a restraint. |
| Field Medic | Restore 1d4 STR damage daily with a medkit. This depletes the medkit. |
| Hard to Kill | Exceptionally resilient, granting an advantage when making life-saving rolls. |
| Metalhead Companion | A loyal, autonomous metalhead. It has a very sophisticated AI for its type. It assists your character in adventures and communicates with them (and while typically amiable, they aren’t mere puppets and can sometimes disagree.). The character needs to purchase the Drone/Metalhead. |
| Parkour | Gain advantage in activities involving jumping, climbing, falling, or using levpacks. |
| Physical Resilience | Possess remarkable endurance and stamina. Add two more inventory slots. |
| Precise | Re-roll damage rolls of 1. |
| Quick Sleep | Require only four hours for full rest and recovery from Fatigue at double the normal rate. |
| Specialist | You have deep knowledge in one specific area, like thievery or engineering. This feat can be selected multiple times for various knowledge areas. |
| Unarmed Combatant | Your bare hands are lethal weapons, rivaling the threat of knives in less skilled hands. Get advantage when rolling damage for unarmed attacks |
| Stealthy | Move silently and undetected, gaining an advantage in stealth-related rolls. |
| Vehicle Prodigy | Exceptional skill in piloting a specific class of vehicle, be it land, sea, or air. |
| Weapon Proficiency | Specialized training or talent with a specific weapon, providing an advantage when using that weapon. |

## Hacks

Neuromancers possess a unique form of power: they run hacks. Through
their Neuralink implants, they interact with the connected landscape
around them. When a PC says they're "running a hack", they must then add
a Fatigue to inventory, occupying one slot.

### Hacking objects and devices

In this world, everything is connected --- from AR interfaces like
Neuralinks to everyday items like door locks, clothes, and even grocery
packages. Some objects are connected directly to the Internet, but most
use a peer-to-peer, low-power protocol called "beehive", allowing
connections within a 50-foot/30-meter radius. While they don't connect
directly to the Internet, they form a mesh network by connecting to
every other object around - and those with direct Internet connection
securely share access so beehive-only objects can transfer data as
needed.

Neuromancers can interface with these mesh networks, bypassing their
security to perform actions like detecting devices and unlocking doors.
This also means that most hacks require the Neuromancer to be present
within the action scene or vicinity to run a hack. They can't be on the
other side of the city and expect to access a specific mesh network --
they need to be immersed in the environment where the action is taking
place.

#### Activation Alert

Plant this hack on a target object or device, then receive an alert when
someone tries to use it (Like a door lock, an appliance, a toy...). If
the Neuromancer is nearby, they will receive the alert immediately;
otherwise, the alert will be delayed since the device has to wait for a
bridge device in the mesh network to give it internet access.

#### Active Armor Push

Check Active Shielding Armor in the equipments section. This hack aligns
all vectored charges in a single direction, then detonates them, dealing
1D4 damage and pushing the target up to 5 feet. Targets must make a DEX
save to avoid stun and losing their turn. Usable once per Active
Shielding Armor.

#### Battery Zap

Inflicts 1d4 damage by forcing a device with high-voltage capacitors
(like tasers, Gauss rifles, portable EMPs, and active armors) to rapidly
discharge beyond safety limits. This results in intense heat and an
electrical arc, affecting the individual holding/wearing the device.

#### Detect device

Detects any type of equipment connected in mesh. Players can choose one
kind of object (metalheads, guns, active armor, drones, keycards, etc)
to find those in range.

#### Detect Security Sensors

Identifies security measures like infrared (IR) laser tripwires, motion
detectors, and pressure-sensitive floors in high-security zones. This
hack scans for any security devices designed to detect unauthorized
presence.

#### Manipulate Security Sensors

Disables or alters security sensors' functions. For instance, it can
adjust IR sensors to ignore the neuromancers' movements. The player can
also use this manipulation creatively instead of simply disabling to
pass through. For example, A Neuromancer detects an area covered by
motion sensors, but instead of disabling them, they see an opportunity
to cause a distraction to the security team: they set the sensors to a
much higher sensitivity, triggering false alarms from minor
disturbances.

#### Identify Owner

Reveals the name of the person this object is registered to, if there
are any.

#### Lock Gun

In this world, every single firearm and gauss rifle legally sold is
"smart": Connected to other devices and automatically locked. Only a
registered user (or users) can fire them (detection happens either via
biometry or a transponder). This hack tricks a gun safety locking
mechanism, causing it to lock even for its registered user.

#### Manipulate Communication feed

Watch or override real-time video/audio feeds from standalone devices
like security cameras and microphones, excluding integrated systems like
AR interfaces or metalheads.

#### Open Lock 1

Hack used for opening digital locks on doors and windows. This hack
works for all locks, from homes to office buildings, except for
high-security domains (military, some corporation headquarters). DM can
assume that all locks in this world are digital (passwords, cards, or
biometry), except when having a physical key is essential to the
narrative.

#### Open Lock 2

Hack used for opening digital locks on doors and windows in
high-security systems, often reserved for military applications and
advanced defense mechanisms. Prerequisite: Open Lock 1

#### Jam lock 1

It makes a lock inoperative, jamming the door in its current state
(locked or unlocked). Works for all sorts of locks outside of
high-security domains.

#### Jam lock 2

Makes high-security lock inoperative. Prerequisite: Jam Lock 1

#### Weapon jailbreak

This hack breaks a smart gun safety locking mechanism that restricts
usage to a designated person, letting the gun be used by anybody.

### Local System penetration

Everything that is connected can be hacked or stolen. Thus, complete
disconnection is the only safe way to securely store and handle
sensitive data. Corporations often have secure servers on their
buildings, where employees must be physically present within specialized
faraday cage workspaces --- shielded environments where they can
interact with server data via augmented reality while ensuring no signal
will leak.

In game terms, this means that infiltrating a physical location is
necessary to perform a hack on these systems. Once a Neuromancer gains
access to one of these secured workspaces, they can automatically bypass
the digital defenses and logins. They can freely search, retrieve, and
copy files and data; however, they must run hacks to make changes.

#### Control Environment

Allows you to control physical elements within the place. Architectures
like elevators, sprinklers, lights, etc.

#### Logic Bomb

Plants a delayed-action hack that can disrupt, destroy, or alter data at
a specified time or when certain conditions are met.

#### Modify without trace

Modify any data on the system without leaving a log of your activity.

#### Purge

Purge will spread through all local nodes in the system and delete all
data.

#### Ransomware

Encrypt files and data, locking them down under a secure password. Often
used for leverage, the target will be forced to negotiate to regain
access.

#### Server Disruption

A powerful hack that can temporarily 'stun' servers, causing a loss of
function that can bring operations to a standstill, similar to an EMP
effect but targeted and without physical damage.

#### Silence Protocol

This hack mutes all alarms and notifications for a duration, allowing
other invasive operations to be carried out without immediate detection.

#### Synthetic Alibi

Generates false activity logs, making it appear as though a real user
(chosen by the Neuromancer) was active in the system at a specific time,
which can be used to fabricate alibis or cast suspicion elsewhere.

### Augmented Reality hacks

Since everyone uses an augmented reality implant, these can manipulate
perceived reality.

#### Auditory Illusion

Manipulate a target's AR to create illusory sounds that seem to come
from a direction of your choice.

#### Dispel AR

Dispels a piece of AR, either created by other hacks (Mirage, Virtual
Veil) or a permanent world piece of AR, like a sign, building facade,
etc.

#### Echoes

Renders a visual trail on everything the target sees and echoes all
sounds they can hear. It would be akin to taking a dose of LSD. Causes
confusion, loss of balance, dizziness, and vertigo. It lasts 3 minutes
but can be run repeatedly by the neuromancer to make the effect last
longer.

#### Neural Stun

This attack momentarily bypasses an AR's safety-level filters to pull
tremendous noise and blinding flashes: The target rolls a DEX save and
gets stunned for 1D4 rounds on failure.

#### Mirage I

Manipulate a target's AR to display and control a virtual element - like
a fake menu, information/stats, notifications, navigational arrows,
virtual decoration, signs, etc... The illusion is clearly a virtual
object, not supposed to look like a real thing.

#### Mirage II

Expands on Augmented Mirage I, allowing the projection and controlling
of elements that seem real: A door that is not there, a blockage in the
sidewalk... Neuromancers can try to go bigger and make an illusion of a
metalhead or a person, but bigger illusions give the target the
opportunity to roll an INS save to detect that what they're seeing looks
uncanny. This hack always requires a WIL save, and the DM can apply a
disadvantage depending on the type of illusion.

#### Sensory Proxy

A neuromancer can plant this hack on local an AR interface, then recall
it over distance to experience what the target sees and hears.

#### Silent Speak

Project your voice into someone's AR interface or through a speaker/comm
system without vocalizing. Allows neuromancer-to-neuromancer
communication. If both neuromancers want, they can continue
communication when they're apart, moving it over the Internet instead of
local mesh.

#### Virtual Veil

Cloak an object or person in the immediate vicinity, making them
invisible or unnoticeable through AR interfaces. This doesn't affect
metalheads or people watching through a video feed, for example. The
Neuromancer needs to keep concentrating on this hack continuously and
will add a Fatigue to inventory for every 10 minutes of
execution.

### Metalhead Hacks

Metalhead hacks are specialized techniques designed to subtly reprogram
autonomous robotic entities. Metalhead hacks always require a WIL save,
and the DM can apply a disadvantage depending on the metalhead.

#### Command

The Neuromancer issues a single-word command that becomes irrefutable to
the metalhead (except if the command would cause the metalhead to harm
itself). For completely controlling a metalhead, see overrides.

#### Emergency Override

Trigger a Metalhead's emergency protocols, forcing it into a safety mode
where it powers down or returns to its docking station for an imaginary
'emergency', thus clearing the area. It's a more extended hack,
requiring 1D20 minutes to accomplish. If the Neuromancer gets
distracted, they might need to start again.

#### Extract route

Allows the Neuromancer to see a map of the latest movements of this
metalhead.

#### Metalhead Sensory Proxy

A neuromancer can plant this hack on metalhead, then recall it over
distance to experience what the target sees and hears.

#### Pacify

Temper a metalhead aggression protocols. It won't change their
directive: A Metalhead programmed to guard a door will still try to
prevent you from going through - but instead of shooting, it might try
to grapple you, for example.

#### Virtual Fence

Allows the Neuromancer to draw an invisible boundary a metalhead cannot
cross

### Self Hacks

The journey to become a Neuromancer is a journey of self-discovery. As
neuromancers delve into the art of self-hacking, they unlock profound
abilities that alter their own biological framework. These internal
alterations are not without risks, requiring a deep understanding of
one's own limits and potentials.

#### Adrenal Override

Tap into your body's adrenaline system to override exhaustion and pain.
Players can use this self-hack to clean 3 Fatigue marks on the inventory
slots at the cost of -1 on the PC STR (due to body stress)

#### Altered Time Rate

For one turn, your own rate of time perception becomes faster than that
of a normal human. Lets you experience time twice as fast as a normal --
that is, you experience two subjective seconds for each real second that
passes. Your body doesn't actually move faster, but you can make quicker
decisions, meaning that lets you take one additional maneuver on your
turn in combat, allowing you to shoot multiple rounds, and cast 2 hacks
on the same turn. Out of combat, the Altered Time Rate allows you the
luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything
seems to happen in slow motion.

#### Memory Pack

Temporarily enhances short-term memory retention, allowing the
Neuromancer to quickly absorb and recall large amounts of information.
When trying to remember, the player rolls a WIL save.

#### Metabolic slowdown

Allows the neuromancer to manipulate their own biological processes,
such as heart rate, blood circulation, digestion, and breathing. This
unique hack enables a trance that mirrors death. To the untrained eye,
the PC appear lifeless. The PC defense becomes non-existent in this
state: your hit protection goes to zero. PC's predetermine a mental
"timer" to awaken after a certain amount of time has passed.

#### Pain Transference

Converts incoming pain signals into something more manageable, like mild
discomfort or a tingling sensation, allowing the Neuromancer to endure
situations that would normally be debilitating due to pain.

#### Recall

The neuromancer recalls a single forgotten or obscured fact or event as
if they had run \"Memory Pack\" at the time. Requirements: Memory Pack

#### Sensory Amplification

Enhance your natural senses for 1d4 hours. Acts like the Discriminatory
Senses feat.

### Social Engineering Hacks

Social Engineering Hacks leverage Neuralink implants to manipulate
social interactions. These hacks are precise tools for influence but
require that the target have a neuralink implant.

#### Addle Brain

Disrupts neural activity in the prefrontal cortex, impairing the
target\'s executive functions and decision-making capabilities. Target
must pass WIL save or drop to 1 WIL for 30 minutes.

#### Confidence Cascade

Amplify the Neuromancer's social signaling, making them appear more
trustworthy and authoritative to the target.

#### Confusion

Subtly disrupt the neural feedback in a target\'s brain, causing
momentary confusion or distraction, useful in delicate negotiations or
escapes.

#### Detect Neuralink

Detects if the target has a Neuralink implant

#### Emotion Trigger

Influence an individual's mood by subtly altering the output of their
Neuralink implant, inducing calm, fear, or aggression.

#### Sense emotion

Senses an individual's mood and broad emotions they are feeling at the
moment.

## Equipment

Bulky items take up two inventory slots and are typically two-handed or
awkward to carry.

### Armor

|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| Tactical Jacket (Armor 2) | A padded jacket made with fabric layers intertwined with a shear-thickening fluid that hardens upon impact | $400 |
| Aramid (Armor 3, bulky) | Standard vest made from aramid fibers, commonly known as Kevlar. | $800 |
| Aramid High Density (Armor 4, bulky) | Enhanced high-density aramid vest for superior protection. | $1,300 |
| Nano Ceramic (Armor 5, bulky) | High-density aramid vest reinforced with nano-ceramic elements. | $1,800 |
| Active shielding (+ 1 Armor) | Add-on to any armor, an array of sensors, extremely powerful electromagnets, and vectorized explosive micro-charges. When incoming metallic objects like bullets or explosion shards are inches away, it activates the electromagnets in the impacted region and detonates the closest charge. The strong magnetic field and shockwave decelerate the bullet | $550 |

### Firearms

All firearms legally sold come with a biometric lock that only allows
the weapon to be used by its owner. These prices are for the legal
market. Jailbroken (unlocked) firearms can be found on the black market,
and it's often around 50% more expensive. It's up to the DM to allow or
not the PCs to acquire jailbroken guns from the beginning.

### Gauss Rifle

A Gauss Rifle (commonly known as RailGun) is a weapon that uses
electromagnetism to propel its rounds: It's Completely silent, but
projectiles go slower. Allows for different kinds of projectiles that
will produce different effects.

|         |             |       |           |         |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| RailGun | Gauss Rifle | Bulky | 40 rounds | \$1,800 |

#### Projectile Types

Stun: \$20 per 10 units

- The projectile opens its shell when propelled, revealing needles and
    a fast discharge capacitor.

- Character rolls save vs.  Impaired 1 round.

Explosive: \$25 per 10 units.

- The projectile explodes when hitting the target. 2D8 damage

EMP: \$100 per 10 units

- Upon hitting, the projectile emits an electromagnetic pulse: Any
    small equipment is entirely disabled, larger equipments are
    partially disabled. Some equipments have to be manually restarted to
    work again; sensitive and military equipment will automatically
    restart in 1d20 minutes (or at the discretion of the GM).

Track Cam: \$100 per 10 units

- Has to be synced to a person via a complicated mechanism -
    neuromancers can immediately connect effortlessly. Will take a burst
    of 30-100 photos (depending on the range) and transit wirelessly to
    the synced person's AR. With the railgun strength set to a low
    level, It's completely silent except for the slight noise of
    projectile hitting something.

Flare: \$20 per 10 units.

- It emits a flare trail invisible to anyone except the synced people,
    who see it clearly overlaid on their AR. Lasts for 30 minutes.

Pack of assorted projectiles: \$400 for 50 Stun, 30 Explosive, 10 EMP,
10 Track Cam, 10 Flare.

### Melee weapons

Vibroblade: These weapon's blades vibrate thousands of times per second,
producing devastating damage compared to a regular blade. Because they
vibrate so rapidly, their movement is invisible.

Stun Batons: Also known as shock sticks, they can deliver a low-power
electric shock used to disrupt the victim's nervous system. They are
commonly used by the police.

#### GexV

The GexV is a compact, high-speed, terrestrial drone designed for rapid
deployment and pursuit. Built for speed and resilience, it boasts an
impressive armored frame capable of withstanding significant damage
while maintaining

top speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. Armed for engagement, the GexV
comes equipped with a 7.5mm gun, capable of delivering a barrage of
firepower at a rate of 900 rounds per minute (4D10), with an ample
reserve of 6000 rounds stored within its chassis. Optionally, the GexV
can carry two micro-spike missiles.

### Metalheads

Advanced robotics are ubiquitous in daily life. Agile and resilient,
they move around the city in public spaces, homes, and corporate
buildings, doing all sorts of jobs. Their internal metal frameworks and
mimicry of human and animal forms have led people to affectionately call
them "metalheads."

#### Sentinel

Sentinel is a security robot initially designed for the vigilant
oversight of public spaces. It's about as tall as a person and moves
smoothly on tracks, so it can easily roll through crowds. The Sentinel
isn't armed; its job is to be there, watch, and be seen (providing a
subtle level of intimidation). It has cameras all around to see
everything and a speaker to give out instructions or warnings.
Corporations became big buyers of Sentinels, retrofitting them with
surveillance capabilities to track individuals of interest or monitor
employee productivity.

#### Spot 1

Spot 1 stands as the first widely accessible, multipurpose robot,
achieving global sales in the millions. Its compact size, agility, and
ability to carry significant weight have made it a valuable asset in
various settings. It serves as an aid for the elderly and people with
disabilities, assists maintenance crews and handymen, becomes an office
helper, and, inevitably, is used by security forces large and small. Its
popularity generated a multitude of third-party accessories (articulated
arms and grippers, different types of cargo containers and bags,
customized tool kits for specific maintenance tasks, etc.) and a
second-hand market (prices ranging from \$4,500 to \$10,000). The
Watch'nPatrol variant is outfitted with sophisticated sensory equipment,
and one of its front limbs is modified to discharge 9mm Luger rounds,
holding a 16-round capacity. While not an AGI, Spot 1 is powered by a
competent AI system. These robots can operate in unison, forming a
networked swarm to execute coordinated tasks ranging from surveillance
to tactical maneuvers.

#### Spot Ultra

|     |     |       |
|-----|-----|-------|
| STR | DEX | ARMOR |
| 12  | 15  | 3     |

Spot Ultra is the advanced iteration of the original multipurpose robot,
designed with a focus on security, especially for corporation's private
forces. Its frame, made from composite materials, is built to endure the
stress of combat and demanding environments. The robot's movement is
swift and precise, with enhanced actuators that enable it to navigate
complex terrain. It incorporates technologies that minimize noise and
reduce its thermal signature, making it an ideal candidate for covert
operations. Spot Ultra is also capable of hosting a range of defensive
equipment. Its framework allows for the integration of modular weapon
systems, including non-lethal options for crowd control or, where
permitted, more aggressive defense mechanisms. The sophisticated AI
of Spot Ultra doesn't possess AGI-level adaptability but offers
exceptional reliability in surveillance, coordinated maneuvers, and
threat response. Whether it's a standalone unit or part of a larger
fleet.

#### Alto

This humanoid robot is designed for an impressive range of motion,
enabling it to perform complex tasks with grace and precision. It can
navigate rugged terrains, leap over obstacles, and even perform
acrobatic maneuvers. The robot is available in four distinct models:

"Work P": This unarmed version is built for labor-intensive
work, such as on construction sites for tasks
requiring strength and delicate assembly or in warehouses managing
inventory and transport... While it comes without weaponry, it is
often retrofitted with third-party kits to add guns and rifles
(In those cases, it can reload but can't shoot two guns
simultaneously.).

|     |     |       |                           |
|-----|-----|-------|---------------------------|
| STR | DEX | ARMOR | Damage                    |
| 12  | 13  | 4     | 1D8 (9mm shots, 120 rnds) |

"Non-lethal Watchman": Equipped for crowd control and non-lethal
intervention, this model is equipped with a robust build and can deploy
four taser projectiles at once. It carries a supply of 40 rubber bullets
and has a pepper spray reservoir equivalent to 10 cans, which it can
project in a jet up to 2 meters.

"Security Watchman": This version is designed for more aggressive
security measures, capable of deploying eight taser projectiles at once
and loaded with 120 rounds of 9mm Luger ammunition for lethal force
scenarios.
|  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| STR | DEX | ARMOR | Damage |
| 12 | 12 | 4 | 1D10 (.40 shots, 30 rnds)
1D12 (.42 shot, 25 rnds) |

Military-Grade Model: The most advanced in its series, this model boasts
dual firearms, each capable of firing 500 rounds of 7.5mm ammunition per
minute, with a total of 1000 rounds stored internally. Optionally, it
can be fitted with a shoulder-mounted micro-spike missile or a grenade
launcher for heavy-duty combat scenarios.

#### Anz

The ANZ is the most sophisticated humanoid

robot. Specially engineered for high-stakes

scenarios, ANZ has unparalleled agility and dexterity.

It features improved joint flexibility and

faster servo-motors, allowing for a broader

range of motion and quicker reactions. The robot\'s structure is
lightweight yet robust, enabling high-speed movement and complex
acrobatics. This lightweight frame sacrifices some of the heavy armor
found in the Alto models (especially the Security Watchman and
Military-Grade Models) - This design choice prioritizes agility and
speed over defense, making ANZ ideal for scenarios where maneuverability
and quick action are crucial, such as in advanced reconnaissance or
emergency response, rather than direct combat roles.

#### Behemoth-6

The Behemoth-6 is a six-legged combat robot engineered for frontline
engagement. Its design, emphasizing stability and resilience, allows it
to carry a greater array of weaponry and defensive systems. The added
legs contribute to a slower movement speed, yet they afford the
Behemoth-6 an unmatched steadiness, particularly in uneven or
treacherous terrain. This machine's imposing presence on the battlefield
is not just due to its size but also its ability to bear the weight of
enhanced armor plating and a diverse arsenal, from mounted cannons to
missile launchers.
