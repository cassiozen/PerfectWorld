  <Card title="About">
The Perfect World setting tells a story of human ambition, its ascension and fall, and the struggle for power in a world where technology binds everything. It delves into how AI, once humanity’s greatest ally, became a tool of corporate subjugation.
Players act as neuromancers, hackers who can manipulate connected devices around them in ways that defy comprehension. If “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, neuromancers are the wizards of this age, holding the potential to reclaim a society on the brink of collapse.
Forge your narrative in a world balanced on the razor’s edge between utopian dreams and a dystopian reality.

  <Card title="What Sets it Apart?">
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Unique hacking mechanics:</strong> Unlike many cyberpunk RPGs where hacking can feel like a separate mini-game, Perfect World integrates hacking into the main gameplay, ensuring everyone stays involved and active, regardless of their character’s focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Surprising DM Role:</strong> The DM isn’t just a narrator or rule enforcer – they secretly play the role of Deus ex Machina, an advanced AI orchestrating resistance from within the game’s narrative. This dual role adds an unexpected layer to the game, allowing the DM to directly influence the narrative, creating a dynamic and unpredictable gaming experience.</li>
  </ul>
