  <Card title="About">
    Perfect World is a cyberpunk role-playing game for one facilitator and at least one other player.<br />
    Players act as neuromancers, hackers who can manipulate connected devices around them in ways that defy comprehension. If "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic", neuromancers are the wizards of this age, the wildcards in a deck rigged by AIs and corporations driving the world to the precipice of chaos.
